Question : Explain very briefly any 5 basic git commands.

Answer:  5 basic Git commands

# git clone 

It Creates a copy of an existing Git repository. Cloning is the most common way for us to obtain a  copy of a main repository. We can copy the whole repositories into our device by using this simple command. 

# git fetch 

Fetching downloads a branch from another repository, along with all of its associated commits and files. But, it doesn't try to integrate anything into out local repository. This gives us a chance to inspect changes before merging them with our project.

# git clean

Removes untracked files from the working directory. This is the logical counterpart to git reset, which only operates on tracked files.

# git init

This is the command we need to use if we want to start a new empty repository or to reinitialize an existing one in the project root. It will create a .git directory with its subdirectories

# git commit

After changes are done locally, we can save them by “committing” them. A commit is like local a snapshot of the current state of the branch, to which we can always come back.
